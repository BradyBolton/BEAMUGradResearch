# README - Rough Experiment Code

* **1.1**: Minimal code to run load-cell and encoder on a single UNO
* **1.2**: Expansion of `1.1`, to select which instruments to read from
* **1.3**: Expansion of `1.1`, integrated with `TestPositionChange.m` to drive the Dynamixel (just try to get it running)
* **1.4**: Fine-tuning `1.3` for the final experiment
